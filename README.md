“Human Age and gender classification” are two of the many important information gathering resource from and individual. Human faces provide enough data which may be used for many purposes. In order to reach the correct audience human age and gender classification is very essential. Here we tried to do the same process but with general equipment. The efficiency of the algorithm depends on several factor but the main motif of this project is being easy and faster while also being as accurate as possible.


 Work is being done to the improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Some future improvements include discarding the face like non-human objects, more datasets for people belonging to different ethnic groups and more granular control over the workflow of the algorithm.























Future Scope:

In AI software program application that is used to locate the age and gender of users who passes through based on line face analyses and automatically starts off evolved playing commercials based totally on the centered audience. A model that determines your age from your photographs using facial popularity. it may bet your age and gender alongside that also can locate multiple faces in a photo and estimate the age of each face.




Uses: 

•	In a marketing organisation, the target audience is identified. 
•	During the recruitment process, to ensure the applicants' validity.  Verification of the identity of those applying for government identification cards.  
•	In the medical sector, a forensic department collects information about deceased people.  
•	In the banking industry, age and gender detection can be used to extract information about an individual from photos. 
•	The Criminal Investigation Department will compile information on the suspects based on their age and gender.
•	Classification of human resources in bulk.
